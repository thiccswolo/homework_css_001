<h1>Pretty Halcyon Days</h1>

<h4>How pleasant to sit on the <span class="beach">beach</span>,</h4>
<P> <BR>
  On the <span class="beach">beach</span>
, on the sand, in the sun, <BR>
With<span class="ocean"> ocean</span> galore within reach, <BR>
And nothing at all to be done!
<BR>No letters to answer,
<BR>No bill be burs toned,
<BR>No work to be shirked,
<BR>No cash to be earned.
<BR>
It is pleasant to sit on the <span class="beach">beach</span><BR>
With nothing at all to be done.&nbsp;
<p></P>

<h4>How pleasant to look at the <dt class="ocean">ocean</dt>,</h4>
<P> <BR>
  Democratic and damp; indiscriminate; <BR>
  It fills me with noble emotion <BR>
  To think I am able to swim in it. <BR>
  To lave in the wave, <BR>
  Majestic and chilly, <BR>
  Tomorrow I crave; <BR>
  But today it is silly. <BR>
  It is pleasant to look at the <span class="ocean">ocean</span>;<BR>
  Tomorrow, perhaps, I shall swim in it. 
<p></P>
<dt> 
  <h4>How pleasant to gaze at the sailors,</h4>
  <P> <BR>
    <span class="yellowback">As their sailboats they manfully sail <BR>
    With the vigor of vikings and whalers <BR>
    In the days of the viking and whale. <BR>
    They sport on the brink <BR>
    Of the shad and the shark; <BR>
    If it's windy they sink; <BR>
    If it isn't, they park. <BR>
    It is pleasant to gaze at the sailors, <BR>
    To gaze without having to sail.</span>&nbsp; </P>
  </dt>

<h4>How pleasant the salt anaesthetic</h4>
<P> <BR>
  Of the air and the sand and the sun; <BR>
  Leave the earth to the strong and athletic, <BR>
  And the sea to adventure upon. <BR>
  But the sun and the sand <BR>
  No contractor can copy; <BR>
  We lie in the land <BR>
  Of the lotus and poppy; <BR>
  We vegetate, calm and aesthetic, <BR>
  On the <span class="beach">beach</span>, on the sand, in the sun. 
<p></P>
